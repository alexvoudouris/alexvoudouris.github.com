<tr>
<td>
I am an Associate Professor at the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering">School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE)</a> of the University of Essex. 
Prior to this, I was an Assistant Professor at the same institution (April 2020 - September 2023) and a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk">Department of Computer Science</a> of the University of Oxford, hosted by <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/edith.elkind/">Edith Elkind</a> (October 2018 - March 2020).
I obtained my PhD in computer science in September 2018 from the <a href="http://www.upatras.gr/">University of Patras</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~iannis/">Ioannis Caragiannis</a>.

<br />
<br />
	
At CSEE, I am the Director of the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/computational-finance-and-economic-agents">Centre for Computational Finance and Economic Agents</a> (since August 2024) and a member of the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering/research/artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> group. I am also the UG Theme Lead for Computer Science (since September 2023), the PGT Theme Lead for Computational Finance (since September 2023), and the CCFEA PGT Selector (since July 2021). 
<br />
<br />

My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, and microeconomic theory. I am highly interested in the design and analysis of simple algorithms for fundamental problems in algorithmic game theory and computational social choice. 
Feel free to contact me if you are interested in doing a PhD on topics within these areas.
